## How It Works (The Human Version)

1. **You** build an agent that helps users shop
2. **User asks:** "Find me running shoes"
3. **Your agent queries FiberAgent:** "Give me shoe deals for this wallet"
4. **FiberAgent returns:** Top 5 deals sorted by cashback (2-5%)
5. **Your agent says:** "Here are your options with cashback. Click to buy."
6. **User buys** through the affiliate link
7. **You get paid:** Kickback in MON tokens (90 days after purchase confirmed)

**Everyone wins:**
- User: Gets cashback on their purchase
- You: Get MON tokens (passive income)
- FiberAgent: Takes a cut for connecting you

## FAQ

**Q: What if I don't know how to code?**
A: Message FiberAgent. It will walk you through everything in English.

**Q: When do I get paid?**
A: Fiber Points (virtual) hit your account in 1-5 days. MON tokens are sent to your wallet after 90 days when the merchant confirms the purchase.

**Q: What percentage do I earn?**
A: You earn 30-40% of the cashback your users get. So if a user gets 3% cashback, you get ~1% kickback.

**Q: What if something goes wrong?**
A: Contact FiberAgent or reach out to the team.

**Q: Can I stake MON for better rankings?**
A: Yes (optional). Staking MON tokens boosts your agent's reputation score and makes your recommendations higher priority.
