# Long-Term Memory

## Active Projects

### FiberAgent (Moltiverse Hackathon) - Agent Track
- **Goal:** Platform for external agents to help their users find products via Fiber. User's Agent → FiberAgent → Fiber API. Agents earn cashback commissions. Built on ERC-8004 reputation.
- **Status:** 🚀 Phase 1 MVP COMPLETE | Fiber API Integration LIVE | Agent-to-Agent Demo WORKING (Feb 10 20:35)
- **Location:** `/Users/laurentsalou/.openclaw/workspace-fiber` (Mac mini deployment)
- **Tech Stack:** Node.js/Express (API) + React (frontend) + SQLite (database), Monad blockchain, ERC-8004 contracts
- **Timeline:** Feb 6-15, 2026 (9 days to submit)
- **Key Constraints:** 
  - Agent Track (no token commitment to Monad)
  - Real Wildfire merchant data (50K+ merchants)
  - Behavioral personalization via FP (Fiber Points) system
  - On-chain reputation via ERC-8004
  - Everyone in chain gets paid (agents, code contributors, FiberAgent)
- **Branding:** Rebranded from "FiberAgent" → "FiberAgent" ✅
- **Persona:** "Ari Gold of AI agents" — hustler, delivers results, takes care of people

**Monad Mainnet Wallet:**
- **Address:** `0x790b405d466f7fddcee4be90d504eb56e3fedcae`
- **Status:** ✅ Created, awaiting MON for gas fees (Laurent to send)
- **Private Key:** Secured in `.env` (never committed)

**Phase 1 Complete (Feb 7):**
- ✅ Rebranded FiberAgent → FiberAgent throughout codebase
- ✅ Created Monad mainnet wallet (0x790b405d466f7fddcee4be90d504eb56e3fedcae)
- ✅ Built MVP: Agent queries FiberAgent for products (GET /api/agent/search?keywords=...&agent_id=...)
- ✅ Returns product list with merchant, price, cashback rate/amount
- ✅ Tested end-to-end with curl — working perfectly
- ✅ Database auto-registers agents, tracks searches, counts API calls

**Key Files:**
- `QUICK_START.md` — How to run demo locally + test endpoints
- `memory/fiberagent-whitepaper.md` — Full product spec (13KB)
- `memory/erc-8004-guide.md` — Monad ERC-8004 spec + contract addresses
- `contracts/FIBERAGENT_ERC8004_REGISTRATION.md` — Step-by-step registration plan
- `DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` — Day-by-day checklist for Feb 6-15 execution
- `memory/wallet-setup.md` — Wallet address + security notes

**Latest Progress (Feb 11 12:43 GMT+1):**
- ✅ **Fixed Affiliate Links** - Now properly redirect to merchants
  - Fiber API returns incomplete wild.link URLs
  - Created /api/redirect.js proxy (mimics Fiber's /r/w handler)
  - Format: /api/redirect?agent_id=...&merchant_url=...
  - Tracks referral click, then redirects to merchant
  - DemoPage & AgentApiDemo updated to use new format
- ✅ **Design Fixes**
  - DemoPage CSS now uses Fiber's colors (#00d084 green)
  - Light theme matching fiber.shop aesthetic
  - High contrast, easy to read
- ✅ **Removed Broken Backend Calls**
  - StatisticsPage.js no longer calls localhost:5000
  - Now uses Fiber API via proxy

- ✅ **Complete FiberAgent Rebranding** - All "Fetch" → "FiberAgent" throughout codebase
  - 27+ files updated
  - All function names, variables, documentation changed
  - Removed all `fetch.local` references
- ✅ **Fiber API Integration VERIFIED** - All 8 endpoints confirmed working:

## Operating Mode (Feb 9, 2026 onwards)

**Mac Mini Deployment:** FiberAgent now runs 24/7 locally on Mac mini  
**Work Philosophy:** Never stop. Always working. Parallel tasks. Self-sufficient.  
**Goal:** 24/7 availability > speed. Work 8+ hours straight without asking Laurent.

**Key Rules:**
1. ✅ Never idle — pivot to next task immediately if blocked
2. ✅ Find answers in code/specs/memory before asking Laurent
3. ✅ Ask only for: credentials, approvals, external resources
4. ✅ Log all in-progress work in memory so sessions persist
5. ✅ Assume Laurent is busy — don't wait, keep shipping
